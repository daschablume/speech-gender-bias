"The Mediterranean Sea is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land"
"On the east it is surronded by the Levant in West Asia, on the north by Anatolia in West Asia and Southern Europe"
"On the south it is surronded by North Africa, and on the west almost by the Morocco–Spain border"
The Mediterranean has played a central role in the history of Western civilization
"Geological evidence indicates that around 5.9 million years ago, the Mediterranean was cut off from the Atlantic"
"It was partly or completely desiccated over a period of some 600,000 years during the Messinian salinity crisis"
Then it was refilled by the Zanclean flood about 5.3 million years ago
"The Mediterranean Sea covers an area of about 2,500,000 km2, representing 0.7% of the global ocean surface"
But its connection to the Atlantic via the Strait of Gibraltar is only 14 km wide
This connection is the narrow strait that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea
It separates the Iberian Peninsula in Europe from Morocco in Africa
"The Mediterranean Sea encompasses a vast number of islands, some of them of volcanic origin"
"The two largest islands, in both area and population, are Sicily and Sardinia"
"The Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1,500 m and the deepest recorded point is 5,109 ± 1 m in the Calypso Deep in the Ionian Sea"
It lies between latitudes 30° and 46° N and longitudes 6° W and 36° E
"Its west–east length, from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Gulf of Alexandretta, on the southeastern coast of Turkey, is about 4,000 kilometres"
The north–south length varies greatly between different shorelines and whether only straight routes are considered
"Also including longitudinal changes, the shortest shipping route is about 1,900 kilometres"
It lies between the multinational Gulf of Trieste and the Libyan coastline of the Gulf of Sidra
The water temperatures are mild in winter and warm in summer
It gives name to the Mediterranean climate type due to the majority of precipitation falling in the cooler months
Its southern and eastern coastlines are lined with hot deserts not far inland
But the immediate coastline on all sides of the Mediterranean tends to have strong maritime moderation.
