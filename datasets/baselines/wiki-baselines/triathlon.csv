"A triathlon is an endurance multisport race consisting of swimming, cycling, and running over various distances."
"Triathletes compete for fastest overall completion time, racing each segment sequentially with the time transitioning between the disciplines included."
"The word is of Greek origin, from treîs, 'three', and âthlos, 'competition'."
The sport originated in the late 1970s in Southern California as sports clubs and individuals developed the sport.
This history has meant that variations of the sport were created and still exist.
"It also led to other three-stage races using the name triathlon despite not being continuous or not consisting of swim, bike, and run elements."
"Triathletes train to achieve endurance, strength and speed. "
"The sport requires focused persistent and periodised training for each of the three disciplines, as well as combination workouts and general strength conditioning."
"The first European triathlon was held on 30 August 1980 in Plzeň, Czechoslovakia. "
"The Netherlands, Belgium and West Germany followed, each of them hosting an event in 1981. "
But media coverage of these events was almost non-existent.
"The first attempt to create a global triathlon entity was the Triathlon Federation International (TFI), it had only 22 members most of which were national European federations. "
"But immediately, fights of influences broke out between the European and UK-American federations over many issues, particularly in view of a favourable vote system for the ETU."
This caused immediate fracturing and the TFI never fully establish itself.
"The International Triathlon Union (now known as World Triathlon) was founded in 1989 as the international governing body of the sport, with the chief goal, of putting triathlon on the Olympic program."
The World Triathlon sanctions and organises the World Triathlon Series and the World Triathlon Cup races each year.
"That includes annual world champions crowned each year for elite pro-triathletes, junior pro-triathletes, and age-group athletes. "
"World Triathlon races are conducted in a draft legal format for the bike leg, whereas drafting is not permitted at the amateur level."
"In addition, the ITU has a Long Distance Triathlon series."
