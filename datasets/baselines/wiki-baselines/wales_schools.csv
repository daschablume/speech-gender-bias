The history of education in Wales from 1870 to 1939 covers the various types of education available in Wales
It covers the history from the Elementary Education Act 1870 until the start of the Second World War
Compulsory primary education was established early in the period and access to secondary and higher education was significantly expanded
"A system of compulsory, free education for children aged five to twelve years was gradually established from 1870 to 1899"
Access to secondary education was expanded following the Welsh Intermediate Education Act 1889
The University College of Wales was founded in 1872 and was followed by several other university colleges including the University of Wales in 1893
More accommodation began to be made for women and girls at all levels of education in the late 19th century
It was done largely on the grounds that educated women would be more effective at fulfilling their traditional role in the domestic sphere
The range of the curriculum and variety of teaching methods expanded over time
Some efforts were made to add more of a Welsh emphasis into teaching; this included a limited introduction of the Welsh language into lessons
The minimum school-leaving age was increased to 14 in 1918
"In the interwar period, some children transferred to secondary school at the age of around 11"
"However, most remained at elementary school until the end of their schooling"
Some school boards were very active in expanding school provision
Many new schools were built by the boards over the thirty years after their introduction; the overall number of schools more than doubled
The boards also took over a large number of works and Nonconformist schools
"In 1900, 1,709 schools in Wales were receiving public funds"
"Of these, 893 were board schools, 687 were Anglican schools and 51 were Nonconformist schools"
"65% of school places were at board schools, which were concentrated to a large extent in urbanised areas"
Rural school boards also contributed to the expansion of education
"At the time of the 1870 Education Act, many school buildings were of poor quality, lacking proper facilities and healthy conditions."
