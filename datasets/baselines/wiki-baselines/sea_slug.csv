Sea slug is a common name for some marine invertebrates with varying levels of resemblance to terrestrial slugs.
"Most creatures known as sea slugs are gastropods, i.e."
Most are partially translucent.
The often bright colors of reef-dwelling species imply that these animals are under constant threat of predators.
"Still, the color can warn other animals of the sea slug's toxic stinging cells (nematocysts) or offensive taste."
"Like all gastropods, they have small, razor-sharp teeth called radulas."
"Most sea slugs have a pair of rhinophores—sensory tentacles used primarily for the sense of smell—on their head, with a small eye at the base of each rhinophore."
"Many have feathery structures (cerata) on the back, often in a contrasting color, which act as gills."
"The ruffles of the lettuce sea slug increase the slug's surface area, allowing the cells to absorb more light.."
"they are sea snails that, over evolutionary time, have either entirely lost their shells or have seemingly lost their shells."
"The name ""sea slug"" is often applied to nudibranchs and a paraphyletic set of other marine gastropods without apparent shells."
All species of genuine sea slugs have a selected prey animal on which they depend for food.
"This includes certain jellyfish, bryozoans, sea anemones, plankton, and other species of sea slugs."
Sea slugs have brains.
"For example, Aplysia californica has a brain of about 20,000 nerve cells."
"Like many nudibranchs, Glaucus atlanticus can store and use stinging cells, or nematocysts, from its prey in its finger-like cerata."
"Other species, like the Pyjama slug Chromodoris quadricolor, may use their striking colors to advertise their foul chemical taste."
The lettuce sea slug has lettuce-like ruffles that line its body.
"This slug, like other Sacoglossa, uses kleptoplasty."
"Kleptoplasty is a process in which the slug absorbs chloroplasts from the algae it eats, and uses ""stolen"" cells to photosynthesize sugars."
